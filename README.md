# 🧠 Live Object Detection with YOLOv5 and Python

This project implements real-time object detection using a webcam feed and the YOLOv5 deep learning model. Built with Python and OpenCV, it leverages YOLOv5's speed and accuracy to detect and label objects live.

Real-time detection of multiple object classes using your webcam.

## 🧠 What is YOLOv5?

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. YOLOv5, developed by Ultralytics, is one of the most efficient versions:
- Real-time object detection
- Highly accurate predictions
- Lightweight and fast inference

YOLOv5 runs entirely in PyTorch and supports GPU acceleration.
